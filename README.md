# Commit Helper
---
## What does it do?
The commit-helper do exactly what it's name suggest: helps you create and maintain your commit policy by tailoring your commit message into a commit comvention.

## Why should I use this?
Keeping a commit policy may sound like an easy thing to do, but in reality we both know that it isn't.

Sometimes we, the devs, go _full-loco_ while programming and make mistakes when commiting. That's fine, everyone makes mistakes. But, what if those mistakes could be avoided?
