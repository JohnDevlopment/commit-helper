# Commit Helper
---
## What does it do?
The commit-helper do exactly what it's name suggest: helps you create and maintain your commit policy by tailoring your commit message into a commit convention.

## Why should I use this?
Keeping a commit policy may sound like an easy thing to do, but in reality we both know that it isn't.

Sometimes we, the devs, go _full-loco_ while programming and make mistakes when commiting. That's fine, everyone makes mistakes. But, what if those mistakes could be avoided?

## Instalation
Just follow the commands below:

```bash

  # if you don't have git, run $ sudo apt install git first

  # clone the repo into your home
  $ git clone https://github.com/andre-filho/commit-helper.git ~/.commit-helper

  # create a function in your .bashrc
  $ echo "commit(){ python3 ~/.commit-helper/generator.py; }" >> ~/.bashrc

  # reload terminal
  $ source ~/.bashrc

```
